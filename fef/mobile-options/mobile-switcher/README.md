## Dynamically loading Angular2 views

Inspired from [Code reuse in Angular2 Native/Mobile](http://angularjs.blogspot.co.uk/2016/03/code-reuse-in-angular-2-native-mobile.html).

Based on his [Advanced Angular2 seed](https://github.com/NathanWalker/angular2-seed-advanced).

Main code areas of interest (from their repo):

1. [View Broker Service](https://github.com/NathanWalker/angular2-seed-advanced/blob/e78b379fdc8ebc2d69ca9e423bd6a9b26925e2cc/src/frameworks/core.framework/services/view-broker.service.ts)
2. [Core Configuration Service](https://github.com/NathanWalker/angular2-seed-advanced/blob/e78b379fdc8ebc2d69ca9e423bd6a9b26925e2cc/src/frameworks/core.framework/services/core-config.service.ts)

Though I've now removed the Core Configuration Service as it's not needed in our (Web) scenario.
