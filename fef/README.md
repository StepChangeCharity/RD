# "Your Framework"

A place to gather thoughts about a given framework.

Add what you like, here's some pointers.

## Mobile
  Is anything on offer in the framework of particular interest?  e.g. react (supposedly) has server-side rendering which may be good for mobile performance.

## Setup
  Do you need to do anything to get up and running?
   - Installing npm packages
   - webpack
   - web server required
   - recommended IDE?

## Approach
  What's the framework approach?  Is it a full framework for everything? Is it just front-end (e.g. no bias towards what persistence layer is used)
  Is it more a [set of] micro-frameworks and libraries.
  Is it MVC or just MV?
  Can we abstract business logic into POJO?

## First Impressions
  Is it easier to get up and going?

  Is it hard, and if it's hard is there a reason, and is that reason worthwhile the hardship?

## Support
  Who drives the framework?
  Is it likely to be around in 3 years time?
  Is there a major re-work planned (think Angular 2)?
  Is there a lot of coverage on stackoverflow (and more importantly lots of _answered_ questions).
  Is it open source?
  Is it on github?
    - When was the last set of commits?
    - If infrequent is it that's it's finished, or abandoned?

## Documentation & Resources
  Is there a lot of documentation, examples, etc?
  Videos on pluralsight?
  Add links to useful resources

## Portability
  How invested do you need to be?
  e.g. React is a give 100%, ripping it out would be a re-write.

## Percieved performance
  We're not after looking at the timeline in dev tools, just your hunch, e.g. react is compiled so *should*, but Angular can have issues with too many bindings ...

## Complexity
  Again, nothing concrete (we don't have the investment time) - just your *hunches*.

## Gotchas
  Stuff you've found out whilst researching that peeps may need to keep in mind

## Funkiness
  Is there something it offers above the others that may go in it's favour? e.g. replaying actions?

## Random thoughts
  How does it *feel*?

## Ratings
  Give a 1-10 rating on each of the above for comparison purposes?

## Would you recommend it for further investigation?
