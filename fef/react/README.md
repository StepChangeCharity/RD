# React.js

## Mobile
  server-side rendering (not played with)
  React Native (https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) allows the same tech to be used for native apps - how *similar* this is in reality is another thing!

## Setup
  What I was working on used:
  - call npm install webpack -g
  - call npm update
  - call npm install babel-loader --save-dev
  - webpack -w

## Approach
  React is mainly the front-end - not played with FLUX yet.
  No bias towards a persistence layer - I'm using jQuery!

## First Impressions
  Not as easy as Angular.
  It's more verbose, but I suspect performance will be better (than Angular) as you have to tell "what you want" rather than *some magic assumes*.
  Is it worth the hardship? *not sure yet*

## Support
  - Facebook is behind it.
  - They use it for their native apps too.
  Suspect it will be around for a while as they're so heavily invested in it.
  - On github http://facebook.github.io/react/
  - Frequent updates

  Is there a major re-work planned (think Angular 2)?
  Is there a lot of coverage on stackoverflow (and more importantly lots of _answered_ questions).

## Documentation & Resources
  Is there a lot of documentation, examples, etc?
  Videos on pluralsight?
  Add links to useful resources


## Portability
  How invested do you need to be?
  e.g. React is a give 100%, ripping it out would be a re-write.

## Percieved performance
  We're not after looking at the timeline in dev tools, just your hunch, e.g. react is compiled so *should*, but Angular can have issues with too many bindings ...

## Complexity
  Again, nothing concrete (we don't have the investment time) - just your *hunches*.

## Funkiness
  Is there something it offers above the others that may go in it's favour? e.g. replaying actions?

## Random thoughts
  How does it *feel*?

## Ratings
  Give a 1-10 rating on each of the above for comparison purposes?

## Would you recommend it for further investigation?
