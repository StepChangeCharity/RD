## atom

Some useful packages for atom.io:

  * browser-plus - enables browser tab (why not built in? DUNNO!)
  * markdown-scroll-sync - does as it says on the thing
  * react - hightlighter
  * atom-bootstrap3 - bootstrap css intellisense and snippets

If you hit issues with installing atom package:

  - nav to the package install screen
  - note the package folder (something like C:\Users\yourName\\.atom\packages)
  - open a command window and nav to that folder
  - then use **apm install package-name**
